# PHP Learning Journey

## Introduction
This README serves as a record of my learnings in PHP, a powerful server-side scripting language used for web development. PHP enables dynamic content, database interactions, and seamless integration with HTML and CSS.

## What I Have Learned

### 1. Basics of PHP
- Syntax and structure
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`)

### 2. Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Built-in PHP functions (string, array, and mathematical functions)

### 3. Forms and User Input
- Handling form submissions using `$_POST` and `$_GET`
- Validating and sanitizing user input

### 4. Working with Arrays
- Indexed and associative arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Array functions (sorting, searching, filtering)

### 5. Handling Sessions and Cookies

### 7. Database Interaction with MySQL
- Connecting to a MySQL database using `mysqli` and `PDO`
- Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Preventing SQL injection with prepared statements

### 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP
- Classes and objects
- Properties and methods
- Inheritance and polymorphism

### 9. Error Handling and Debugging
